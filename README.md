### Overview

This program manages a database that houses bar entities. The user is able to view bars already existing in the database, edit information, delete entities, or add new entities.

The program consists of bar entities held within a MySQL database, a DAO that makes use of JPA, a controller, and several JSPs. The program was made as a Spring Boot project and as such relies on many annotations that are part of the Spring Tool Suite.

### Lessons Learned

This project was very similar to last weekend's so it was a good reinforcer for database, DAO, controller, and JSP relationships. A newly integrated piece of this project was JPA in order to better structure DAO methods and interactions with the database.

This project was also another opportunity to learn CSS and I had fun breaking and fixing the display of the webpage.
